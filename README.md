## Usage

> More detailed instructions and documentation is available in [the wiki](https://github.com/pBouillon/MqttTopicBuilder/wiki)  
> For changelog, see [the changelog](./CHANGELOG.md)

Using a custom builder, `MqttTopicBuilder` allows you to build topics and ensure
their veracity.

```csharp
    var topic = new TopicBuilder()
        .AddTopic("Hello")
        .AddTopic("From")
        .AddTopics("Mqtt", "Topic", "Builder")
        .AddMultiLevelWildcard()
        .Build();

    Console.WriteLine(topic);
    // -> "Hello/From/Mqtt/Topic/Builder/#"
```

The built object is a `Topic` object. It can be used to both access the topic
but also gather informations about it such as its level.

```csharp
    var topic = new TopicBuilder()
        .AddTopic("Hello")
        .AddTopic("World")
        .Build();

    Console.WriteLine(topic.Value);
    // -> "Hello/World"

    Console.WriteLine(topic.Levels);
    // -> 2
```

Topics can also be built using the regular constructor or the extension method:

```csharp
    var topic = Topic.FromString("Hello/World");

    Console.WriteLine(topic.Value);
    // -> "Hello/World"

    Console.WriteLine(topic.Levels);
    // -> 2
```

Topic integrity can also be checked using the `TopicValidator` methods

```csharp
    TopicValidator.ValidateTopic("a/wrong/#/Topic");
    // Will throw an exception since no topic is allowed after '#'

    "wrong+Topic".ValidateForTopicAppending();
    // Will throw an exception since '+' is not allowed in a topic
```
